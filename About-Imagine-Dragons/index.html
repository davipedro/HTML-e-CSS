            <h2>About band early years</h2>
            <p class="highlighted-text">
                <span class="bold">Imagine Dragons</span> was formed in 2008 in Provo, Utah, by lead vocalist Dan Reynolds. The band later relocated to Las Vegas, where they found significant local success. The original lineup saw a few changes before stabilizing with Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. Their big break came in 2012 with the release of their debut album, "Night Visions," which included the hit single "It's Time" and the chart-topping "Radioactive."
